# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I feel confident in my understanding of the "each" method so far. I think its a really useful and powerful tool especially if combined with other methods

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other
  background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

My struggle was mostly productive. I dug a little deeper and found some other cool methods like #each_with_index, #select, #map.
I understood most of the concepts except one in particular.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I think #reduce is a very confusing method to learn especially when used with strings/hashes, I will have to see more examples on how to use it before mod 1.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I always have questions regarding all the methods in ruby. Sometimes I forget what they do or what they return so I have my notes open all the time. If I cant find the answer to a question online, I will ask a cohort-mate or instructor for assistance.
